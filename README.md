# Manipulatin_variables
Scenario: Programs primarily operate by storing data in variables and manipulating that data.  You will write several scripts to do just that.
Coffee_shop is divided into two cells. The first cell greets the user, creates a variable for the cost of a coffee and a pastry each, asks the user to input those prices, then prints out the two given costs. The second cell turns the two previous variables into floats, creates a variable for the total cost equal to the two prior variables added together, then prints the total cost.
